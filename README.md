This little work is an Exploratory Data Analysis on my Spotify data.

I'm working in two branchs here:
- One for analyzing my data from the past year
- The another is for _trying_ to perform an audio analysis on my favorite songs at some moment, to see if I find an audio pattern associate with the moment ``feelings``, based on audio features - Who does not associate currently listening songs to the currently state of the life? (If you don't, I'd say to think again 'cause you may have done it without want). From that pointed, I want to try identify at least one pattern using my signal processing curiosity and background to do it. *It's highly ambicious* 'cause involves audio, probably compressing and dimentionality reduction, and things like that, but let me try it. 

In both branches I'm using Spotify API for Developers to get some extra data - actually the first branch is where I use to get an extra data. The data from the second branch comes all from the API - which I'm discovering its usage according my wants and needs. 

The reference used and which inspired both this project and my ideas are in the Docs.md file.
